## üéß Audio Challenge Write-Up: `secret_tunes.wav`

### üß© Challenge Description
> *‚ÄúI encoded my flag using a different approach. This time it's all about the actual sounds. I learned to play piano with a virtual piano here: https://virtualpiano.net‚Äù*

A `.wav` file named `secret_tunes.wav` was provided. The goal was to decode a hidden flag embedded in the melody played using actual piano sounds.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- **Python (Librosa)**: Used to extract pitch frequencies from the audio file.
- **Frequency-to-Note Conversion**: Converted frequencies to musical notes using scientific pitch notation.
- **Virtual Piano Mapping**: Mapped musical notes to Virtual Piano key presses.
- **Manual Playback**: Played the sequence on Virtual Piano to hear the melody and interpret the result.

#### Script used
```
import librosa
import numpy as np

# Frequency-to-note mapping using scientific pitch notation
def frequency_to_note(freq):
    A4_freq = 440.0
    if freq <= 0:
        return None
    semitones_from_A4 = int(round(12 * np.log2(freq / A4_freq)))
    note_names = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']
    note_index = (semitones_from_A4 + 9) % 12
    octave = 4 + ((semitones_from_A4 + 9) // 12)
    return f"{note_names[note_index]}{octave}"

# Load the audio file
y, sr = librosa.load("secret_tunes.wav")

# Extract pitches and magnitudes
pitches, magnitudes = librosa.piptrack(y=y, sr=sr)

# Extract dominant pitches
note_sequence = []
for i in range(pitches.shape[1]):
    index = magnitudes[:, i].argmax()
    pitch = pitches[index, i]
    if pitch > 0:
        note_sequence.append(pitch)

# Convert frequencies to note names
note_names = []
for freq in note_sequence:
    note = frequency_to_note(freq)
    if note:
        note_names.append(note)

# Remove duplicates while preserving order
unique_notes = []
seen = set()
for note in note_names:
    if note not in seen:
        unique_notes.append(note)
        seen.add(note)

# Print the final unique note sequence
print("üéµ Unique Extracted Notes:")
print(unique_notes)
```

### üéº Extracted Notes

From the pitch analysis, the following notes were identified:

```
C7, E4, C5, F4, F6, B4, C6, B5, A4, A3, D4, G4, B3, D5
```

### üéπ Virtual Piano Key Mapping

Mapped to Virtual Piano keys:

| Note | Key |
|------|-----|
| C7   | Q   |
| E4   | d   |
| C5   | k   |
| F4   | f   |
| F6   | m   |
| B4   | j   |
| C6   | v   |
| B5   | c   |
| A4   | h   |
| A3   | (not mapped) |
| D4   | s   |
| G4   | g   |
| B3   | (not mapped) |
| D5   | l   |

---

### üîç Decoding the Flag

Playing the above sequence on Virtual Piano produced a phonetic output resembling:

```
musicalkpeyord
```

Which was very close to:

```
musicalkeyboard
```

This was confirmed to be the correct flag.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Flag

```
flag{musicalkeyboard}
```

### üß† Lessons Learned

- Audio-based challenges can encode data through pitch and rhythm.
- Mapping musical notes to virtual instruments can reveal hidden messages.
- Tools like Librosa, Virtual Piano, and manual transcription are powerful for solving audio CTFs.
