After inspecting the file. It mentions PNG on the first line. 
The other parts of the text contained looks absolutely crazy and potentially binary or metadata.
Took a chance and made a copy to which I changed the file type to ".png" instead of ".txt"

VOILA!

Message appeared as an image when I open the PNG file. Then all is required is to decode the Braille ASCII message.
