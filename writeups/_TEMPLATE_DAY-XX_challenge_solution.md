## 🧠 Understanding the Problem

🕵️‍♂️ Before jumping in, let's understand what we’re dealing with:

> {{Explain what the problem is asking for — e.g., decrypt an RSA message, extract hidden data, etc.}}

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Solution

### 🔹 Step 1: Initial Observation

🧩 *“What does this look like?”*

* {{ Mention key clues you recognized }}
* {{ Mention why you think it’s an RSA / Stego / Web vuln, etc. }}

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Reconstruct or Analyze the Key Data

If crypto:
[
ϕ(N) = (p-1)(q-1)
]
[
d = e^{-1} \mod ϕ(N)
]

If forensic:

> Use `exiftool`, `binwalk`, `strings`, etc. to analyze metadata.

If web:

> Inspect request/response headers, cookies, and try fuzzing vulnerable parameters.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Perform the Exploit / Decrypt / Extract

```python
# Example Python snippet for RSA
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
d = pow(e, -1, phi)
m = pow(c, d, N)
plaintext = bytes.fromhex(hex(m)[2:]).decode()
print(plaintext)
```

🧾 **Result:**
We get a readable plaintext string once the message integer is converted to bytes.

## 📘 Explanation — *Why It Works*

💡 **In short:**

> {{Write a clear, simple explanation of the concept.}}

Example (RSA):

> RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large primes.
> If you know `p` and `q`, you can compute `ϕ(N)` and derive `d`.
> Then you can decrypt any message encrypted with the public key.

## 📚 Key Learnings

| 🔑 Concept    | 🧠 Takeaway                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| {{Concept 1}} | {{What you learned from it}}   |
| {{Concept 2}} | {{Why it matters in security}} |
| {{Concept 3}} | {{Real-world implication}}     |

Example:

* 🔐 RSA’s security fully depends on prime secrecy.
* 🧮 Modular arithmetic is the core of all asymmetric crypto.
* ⚠️ Never encrypt plaintext directly with RSA — always use padding!
